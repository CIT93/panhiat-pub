# How would we solve water consumption? 

For this assignment, I would create two functions to solve the problem. The first function will calculate the usage points based on how frequently the appliances are used, while the second function will determine the total water consumption points by considering the availability and usage of both the dishwasher and washing machine. Together, these functions will assess and calculate the overall water consumption points based on appliance usage.
