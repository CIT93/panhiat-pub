creating objects we can reuse 

# houseSizePoints Method

For this assignment I grab the entired function of the housesizepoints and brought it into the file fp. I had to update my code because in the constructor i did not use the this to reference the size and the number in household. 

# coding challenge

In this coding challenge for updating render table body, the key and value is refering to the constructor obj value. To refers the value of the value, I did not need to put This in the value. I can just reference with quotes.
